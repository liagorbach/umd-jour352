        <h2>Taylor Swift's Updated Net Worth</h2>
        <p>International superstar Taylor Swift joined the billionaire's club this year, largely due to the success of
            her current tour.</p>

        <p>In September, Bloomberg reported that Swift’s net worth is officially
            <em>$1.1 billion.</em> Though Swift's pockets are heavy, she's yet to beat Barbadian singer, businesswoman,
            actress and songwriter Rihanna, whose net worth is a staggering $1.7 billion as of December 2023.
            Fenty Beauty, the makeup company that Rihanna owns a 50% stake in, is worth $2.8 billion on its own.
        </p>
        <p>
            Swift's money portfoilio has grown quickly over the past few years. In August 2017, Forbes reported that
            Swift’s net worth was $250 million, but it soared to $740
            million in June 2023 after releasing Speak Now TV, 1989 TV, “The Eras Tour” movie and starting the Eras
            Tour.

        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>Taylor Alison Swift was born on Dec. 13, 1989 in West Reading, Pa. She began her career in 2004 with a
            move to Nashville after signing a music publishing deal with Sony/ATV at age 14. Record executive Scott
            Borchetta discovered Swift singing at a showcase at Nashville’s Bluebird Cafe in 2005, and in 2006, Swift
            signed with Borchetta’s Big Machine Records.</p>
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col">
                <h2>Albums</h2>
                <p>Swift released her debut album called Taylor Swift on Oct. 24, 2006. In 2008, she released Fearless,
                    which became the top selling album of 2009 in the United States. From there, she
                    put out eight more albums, four rerecorded ones, five extended plays and four live albums. She
                    has sold an estimated 114 million album units.</p>
                <p><em>When calculating this number, 1,250 premium
                        streams (from a paid subscription like Spotify or Apple Music) from the same album, or 3,750
                        free streams from the same album, is equivalent to one album unit.</em> </p>
                <p>Swift's rerecorded albums have amassed a lot of attention, with fans eager to hear the singer's
                    updated version of her old music as well as 'vault tracks', what Swift calls the handful of new
                    songs she adds to each rerecorded album.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-md-8">

            </div>
        </div>

        <p>The rerecordings spawned after a disupte Swift got
            into with Borchetta, Big Machine’s founder, and the label's new owner, Scooter Braun.</p>
        <p>Braun purchased Swift’s masters and proposed a deal that would force Swift to “earn” her
            old records by turning in new ones. “I learned about Scooter Braun’s purchase of my masters as it
            was announced to the world,” Swift wrote in an Instagram post in 2019.</p>
        <p>Swift is now signed with Republic Records and has been rerecording her old music in order to gain
            ownership of it. </p>
        <p>As for her albums' contributions to Swift's net worth, it’s difficult to determine exactly how much money
            artists make off of album sales and streams, but it's usually around 10-20% of each album sold. So, if a CD
            sells for $15, the artist makes between
            $1.50 and $3.00, according to HowStuffWorks. However, this number isn’t representative of every
            album sale, because of differences between retail and wholesale prices. Additionally,
            record contracts may withhold royalties, and managers and other contributors
            to the album also get a cut of the sales.
        </p>

        <h2>Merchandise</h2>
        <p>Another source of income for Swift lies in her merchandise. Swift offers a variety of merch on her website,
            taylorswift.com, as well as at her concerts. Shirt
            prices average around $45 and sweatshirts clock in between $60 and $85. Keychains, ornaments, tea cups,
            picture frames and other knick knacks are also offered online. </p>
        <p>
            While Swift’s income statements are private, in 2014 Buzzfeed estimated Swift makes eight figures
            annually off of merchandise. With inflation and Swift’s soaring reputation, it’s likely she now makes
            tens of millions of dollars off of her merchandise every year.

        <h2>1989 Albums and Tour</h2>
        <p>Swift has amassed a lot of money from her tours over the years.</p>
        <p>Swift's "1989 World Tour" grossed $250.7 million across 85 shows, according to Billboard. It was the
            highest grossing concert tour of 2015. The 1989 album was released in 2014 and sold 1.287 million copies in
            its
            first week. The rerecorded version, 1989 Taylor's Version, was released on Oct. 27 and sold 1.359
            million copies its first week. The album also had 375 million streams, the most streams garnered in one
            week out of all four of Swift's rerecorded albums.</p>

        <h2>Reputation Tour</h2>
        <p>Swift's "Reputation Stadium Tour" grossed $266.1 million in domestic revenue, according to Billboard.
            Even more money was generated when Netflix filmed and released the entire show, though the specific number
            attached to this deal is not available to the public.

            years, to Netflix for $25 million. The film was released on Jan. 31, 2020.</p>

                <p>Swift began her most recent tour, "The Era's Tour", on March 17. The show is over 3 hours and 44
                    minutes long and includes
                    music
                    from all 10 of Swift’s albums that have been released over the past 17 years. The tour’s first 56
                    shows grossed $780
                    million, and Swift completed her 66th show on Nov. 26 out of the total 151 she has scheduled across
                    the world.
                </p>
                <p>Tickets for the tour sold for an average of $253 and more than 3 million fans have attended a show.
                    Bloomberg
                    estimates Swift has so far earned $370 million from Eras Tour merchandise and ticket sales. Babson
                    College
                    professor Peter Cohan predicts the tour will rake in $4.1 billion by its conclusion. </p>
                <p><em>“If you just took Swift's cut, it would be larger than the yearly economic output of 42
                        countries.
                        It
                        would also be enough to send every American around $17,"</em> according to TMZ. </p>

                <h2>Tour Movie</h2>
                <p>“Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour” movie landed in AMC Theatres on Oct. 13, with adult tickets priced at
                    $19.89.
                    The concert film earned $92.8 million during its three-day debut weekend, making it the highest
                    grossing
                    concert film in history. The previous record was held by the 2011 film “Justin Bieber: Never Say
                    Never”, with a
                    <em>lifetime</em> gross of $73 million.
                </p>
                <p>Swift’s tour production company produced the movie and Sam Wrench directed it. The
                    film runs 165 minutes, and Swift recently announced that an extended version of the movie will be
                    available
                    to
                    rent at home starting on Dec. 13.

                <h2>Economic Impact</h2>
                <p>
                    As fans flock to cities where Swift is playing, they spend an average of $1,300 on tickets, hotels
                    and
                    food, according to the U.S. Travel Association. "The Era's Tour" has boosted the economy in a way
                    that is
                    comparable
                    to the Olympic Games and the FIFA World Cup. Economists have even coined the term
                    <em>'Swiftonomics'.</em>
                </p>
                <p>There's no doubt that Swift will maintain her billionaire status. Her
                    net worth is likely to continue soaring when her tour resumes on Feb. 7 in Tokyo, and after the
                    highly-anticipated release of Reputation Taylor's Version. </p>
