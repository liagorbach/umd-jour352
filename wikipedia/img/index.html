            <p>The 1975 are an English pop rock band formed in 2002 in Wilmslow, Cheshire.[1][2] The band consists of
                lead vocalist, principal songwriter and guitarist Matty Healy, lead guitarist Adam Hann, bassist Ross
                MacDonald, and drummer and primary producer George Daniel.[3][4] The name of the band was inspired by a
                page of scribblings found in Healy's copy of On the Road by Jack Kerouac that was dated "1 June, The
                1975".
                The band members met in secondary school, and first performed together as teenagers in 2002, before
                professionally releasing music in 2012 under independent label Dirty Hit.[5] From 2012 to 2013, they
                opened for several major acts and released a series of extended plays– Facedown, Sex, Music for Cars,
                IV–before releasing their UK chart-topping self-titled debut album (2013), which included the popular
                singles "Sex", "Chocolate", and "Robbers".
                All of the band's albums hit No. 1 in the United Kingdom and charted in the Billboard 200, garnering
                critical praise and appearing in numerous publications' year-end and decade-end lists. Their second
                album, I Like It When You Sleep, for You Are So Beautiful yet So Unaware of It (2016), also reached No.
                1 in the US, Canada, Australia and New Zealand and its box set received a nomination for Best Boxed or
                Special Limited Edition Package at the 59th Grammy Awards.[6] The band's third album, A Brief Inquiry
                into Online Relationships (2018), received widespread acclaim and won British Album of the Year at the
                2019 Brit Awards with its single “Give Yourself A Try” earning a nomination for Best Rock Song at the
                62nd Annual Grammy Awards.[7] It was followed by Notes on a Conditional Form (2020) and Being Funny in a
                Foreign Language (2022) with the latter receiving a nomination for British Album of the Year at the 2023
                Brit Awards.
                Rolling Stone stated that the band has been at "the forefront of modern pop rock" since their debut.[8]
                Pitchfork has described them as a "band of friends" who "ascended from scrappy emo rockers to global
                superstars".[9] Entertainment Weekly has characterized them as "British Phenoms,"[10] with Billboard
                declaring them "the most ambitious pop-rock band of their generation".[11] They have received several
                awards and nominations including four Brit Awards, two Ivor Novello Awards, as well as two nominations
                for the Mercury Prize and Grammy Awards. In addition, they have been awarded "Band of the Decade" at the
                2020 NME Awards.</p>

            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>In 2002, at Wilmslow High School, Adam Hann who plays guitar, recruited Matty Healy to be the drummer of
                a band he was forming with Ross MacDonald who plays bass.[12][13] Hann wanted to form a band because a
                local council worker had begun organising gigs for teens, and wanted to play at one.[14] When the band's
                prospective singer, Elliot Williams, dropped out after one rehearsal, Healy took over the role playing
                double duty as lead vocalist and drummer.[15] He eventually relinquished playing drums to George Daniel,
                recalling that meeting Daniel "changed his life".[16] Daniel describes his first impression of Healy as
                "the most outwardly passionate person in school—endearing, and intimidating."[15] The quartet began as a
                band playing covers of punk and emo songs at school and at Healy's house before eventually writing their
                own music.[14]
                To keep the band together, Hann, MacDonald, and Daniel all went to university in Manchester while Healy
                briefly attended music school.[17][18] They played gigs and recorded their own music while working as
                delivery boys at a local Chinese restaurant.[4]
                By 2010, the band was being managed by Jamie Oborne but remained unsigned due to their genre-hopping
                approach, so he set up his own independent record label–Dirty Hit–and signed the band for 20 pounds.[19]
                Before settling on the 1975, the band performed under multiple names including Me and You Versus Them,
                Those 1975s, Forever Drawing Six,[20] Talkhouse,[21] the Slowdown,[22] and Bigsleep.[23] They have been
                called Drive Like I Do[24] before settling on the band name the 1975 in 2012.[25][26] Healy recounted
                that the final name was inspired by scribblings found on the back page of the book On the Road by Jack
                Kerouac.[3][27][28]
                "I found a page of scribblings [on Jack Kerouac’s On the Road]. It wasn't really disturbing or dark or
                anything... the important thing that stuck with me was that the page was dated '1st June, The 1975'. At
                the time I just thought that the word 'The' preceding a date was a strong use of language. I never
                thought it would be something that would later come to be so important. When it came to naming the band,
                it was perfect.
                —Healy on the band's name
                The band's self-titled debut album was recorded with Mike Crossey.[30] Between autumn 2012 and spring
                2013, during which time the album was recorded, the band released four EPs. They toured to support and
                build momentum for the album, including numerous gigs and special appearances with other artists.
                The album received positive reviews from critics, and topped the UK Albums Chart on 8 September.[31] As
                of March 2016, it had sold 410,981 copies in the UK,[32] and 390,000 copies in the US.[33] Critics at
                Pitchfork have favourably compared them to the Big Pink.[21] Sex EP was described by Paste as "equal
                parts ethereal and synth pop", with "haunting" and "smooth" vocals. Their "mellow", stripped down style
                was praised for its lack of "attention-grabbing production theatrics"
                The release of the band's first EP, titled Facedown, in August 2012 saw the band's first UK airplay on
                national radio with lead track "The City", which was also featured as part of a BBC Introducing show
                with Huw Stephens on BBC Radio 1.[36] The 1975 once again garnered national radio attention in late
                2012, with BBC Radio 1 DJ Zane Lowe championing their single "Sex" from the eponymous EP, which was
                released on 19 November.[37] They embarked on a United Kingdom and Ireland tour extended into early
                2013, before beginning a US tour in Spring 2014.[37] Upon the release of Music for Cars on 4 March 2013,
                the 1975 found mainstream chart success with "Chocolate", reaching number 19 in the UK Singles Chart. On
                20 May 2013 the band released IV, which included a new version of "The City". The track charted in UK
                and received airplay in several other countries.
                The 1975 toured extensively to support releases and to build hype before releasing their debut. The band
                supported Muse on the second leg of The 2nd Law World Tour at the Emirates Stadium in London on 26 May
                2013.[38] They also toured with the Neighbourhood in the United States in June 2013,[39] and supported
                the Rolling Stones in Hyde Park on 13 July.[40] In August, the band performed on the Festival Republic
                Stage at 2013 Reading and Leeds Festivals.[41]
                In a feature article, Elliot Mitchell of When the Gramophone Rings wrote that releasing a string of EPs
                before the debut album was "a move that he deemed necessary to provide context to the band's broad
                sound, rather than just building up with singles alone." Healy said, "We wouldn't have been able to
                release the album without putting out the EP's first, as we wanted to make sure we could express
                ourselves properly before dropping this long, ambitious debut record on people."[41]
                Their self-titled debut, The 1975, was released on 2 September 2013, co-produced by Mike Crossey, known
                for his work with Arctic Monkeys and Foals.[37] The 1975 were selling out shows even before the debut of
                their full-length album as Healy recalled in an interview with Larry Heath of The AU Review.[42] The
                lead single was a re-worked "Sex", which was released on 26 August 2013.[43] The song premiered on Zane
                Lowe's BBC Radio 1 show on 8 July 2013,[44] and a music video premiered on YouTube on 26 July. The 1975
                debuted at number one on the UK Albums Chart.
                Public reaction to the band's music has been mixed, particularly on social media platforms like Twitter,
                "perhaps the last public space for unfettered music criticism in an increasingly anti-critical
                landscape", according to Vice magazine's Larry Fitzmaurice in 2016. In an essay on the critical
                response, he said they have been "the Most Hated and Loved Band in the World" and described "as
                underrated and overhyped, although the needle has far more often swung towards the former
                direction".[45] Veteran rock critic Robert Christgau said he thinks "they suck" and should not be called
                a "rock band" as they do not "rock".[46] In Fitzmaurice's opinion, the band's debut album was mainly a
                straightforward rock album recorded "with a soft-focus and especially British sensibility", while I Like
                It When You Sleep was only rock music in the loosest sense of the word. Overall, he said their music is
                pop "in the realm of Alternative", most comparable to INXS.[45] The 1975 toured in the UK in September
                2013, among others performing in Kingston upon Hull as headliners at Freedom Festival, a celebration of
                the city's shortlisting for 2017 UK City of Culture designation,[47] and at iTunes Festival on 8
                September as an opening act for indie electronic quartet Bastille.
                The band undertook a North American tour in October 2013, a European tour for November, and in January
                2014 the band performed in New Zealand and Australia.[48] In September 2013, the band performed three
                sold-out shows at London's Shepherd's Bush Empire.[49] In April 2014, the band performed for the first
                time in a major American music and arts festival: Coachella.[50] The band played at Royal Albert Hall
                the same month.[51] In May, the band's recorded output was distributed digitally while they were touring
                North America. Healy noted that the band had recording scheduled in Q2 2015.[52]
                On 1 June 2015, the band's social accounts were terminated, which caused intense speculation.[53] A
                comic strip was posted on Healy's Twitter a day prior but was later posted on their manager's (Jamie
                Oborne) account, which suggested the band's break-up.[54] The next day, the accounts were reinstated,
                but the cover images and profile photos were white and light pink, instead of the usual black and white,
                revealing it to be a publicity stunt.[55]
                On 8 October, the band announced their second album, I Like It When You Sleep, for You Are So Beautiful
                yet So Unaware of It.[56][57] They premiered the lead single, "Love Me", simultaneously scheduling a
                support tour in Europe, North America, and Asia.[58] They premiered the second single, "UGH!", on 10
                December on Beats 1.[59] The album's third single, "The Sound" debuted on BBC Radio 1 on 14 January
                2016.[60] The 1975 released the fourth single "Somebody Else" on 15 February on Beats 1[61] before the
                album's release. "A Change of Heart" premiered on Radio 1 on 22 February, four days prior to the album's
                release.
                NME, who had previously been highly critical of the band, praised the album for its scope and ambition,
                writing that "Any record that burrows as deep into your psyche as ‘I Like It…' should be considered
                essential. It's hugely clever and wryly funny, too." They later named it their Album of the Year for
                2016.[62] Although music journalist Alexis Petridis noted that parts of the album were over-ambitious,
                he went on to claim that "incredibly, though, most of the time Healy gets away with it. That's sometimes
                because his observations are sharp — as a skewering of celebrity squad culture, 'you look famous, let's
                be friends / And portray we possess something important / And do the things we like' is pretty acute —
                but more usually because they come loaded with witty self-awareness and deprecation: the endless
                depictions of vacuous, coke-numbed girls he has met would get wearying were it not for the fact that he
                keeps turning the lyrical crosshair on himself." In a more mixed review, Rolling Stone criticised tracks
                like "Lostmyhead" and "Please Be Naked" for being "boring-melty" but praised songs such as "Somebody
                Else", "Loving Someone" and "Love Me".[63]
                The album was released on 26 February and topped the UK Albums Chart and the US Billboard 200.[6] The
                band released a free download for "How to Draw" on Twitter and through Target Exclusive.[64] It was
                shortlisted for the 2016 Mercury Music Prize[65] and nominated for Album of the Year at the 2017 Brit
                Awards.[66]
                On 13 November 2016, member George Daniel teased the band's third album by releasing a video on his
                Instagram account captioned "2018", containing snippets of audio along with Healy playing the
                keyboards.[67]
                On 3 April 2017, Healy tweeted "I like it when you sleep is coming to an end" before following up with
                "Music for Cars", which shares the name of their third extended play.[68] In March 2017, the band
                confirmed that two songs for the new album have already been written.[69] In June, Healy also confirmed
                that Drive Like I Do, one of the 1975's prior incarnations, will release a debut album as a side project
                'in a few years'.[70]
                In November, Healy teased the release of an EP within 2017.[71] Besides being confirmed, the EP was
                delayed to 2018, with manager Jamie Oborne stating that "something" would be released instead; this was
                the band's debut live album, DH00278.[72] He also confirmed that no singles from Music for Cars will be
                released in 2017, with the band confirming that something will be released on 1 June 2018.[73][74] In
                March 2018, the band deleted many media posts across their accounts going back to July 2017, during
                their final show at Latitude Festival for I Like It When You Sleep, for You Are So Beautiful yet So
                Unaware of It.[75] On 22 April 2018, in response to a fan comment on Twitter, Oborne stated that their
                second album's campaign would remain for "a few more days".[76] At the end of April, cryptic posters
                titled "Music for Cars" appeared in London and Manchester, containing taglines and a Dirty Hit catalogue
                number, DH00327, amongst a black background.[77] Various billboards were also spotted in the United
                Kingdom, having used détournement to apply themselves over existing advertisements.[78] The band updated
                their website to display a timer counting down towards 1 June at the beginning of May 2018, becoming
                active again on social media.[79] Within its first hours, it was revealed to contain a hidden zip file
                with four individual posters, each of the names leading to a hidden page on the website that displayed a
                conversation between a 'human' and a 'machine'.[80] Over social media, the band frequently released
                different posters, all titled "A Brief Inquiry Into Online Relationships".[81][82] On 31 May 2018, the
                band released the single "Give Yourself a Try", after premiering as Annie Mac's "Hottest Record in the
                World" on BBC Radio 1 that same day.[83]
                The album garnered almost universal praise from critics. According to review aggregator Metacritic, the
                album has received a weighted score of 83 based on 29 reviews, indicating "universal acclaim".[7] Ryan
                Dombal of Pitchfork gave the album a score of 8.5, earning it the Best New Music tag, and called it
                "outrageous and eclectic", as well as "similar to its predecessor in its boundless sense of style,
                swerving from Afrobeats to brushed-snare jazz balladry to one track that sounds like a trap remix of a
                Bon Iver ayahuasca trip", but "more purposeful" than I Like It When You Sleep.[21] Time considered it
                one of the Best Albums of 2018, placing it at number nine on their list.[84]
                However, Conrad Duncan writing for the same site gave the album a positive review, calling it "full of
                genuine heart, intelligence and wit".[85] Popmatters criticised the album as bloated and inconsistent,
                stating "The band's reach exceeds their grasp here, and vocalist/band leader Matt Healy's indulgences
                are often more tiresome than charming", while still praising it as "fascinating".[86] Healy, in an
                interview for Beats 1, said that "Music for Cars" is more of an era to release music, after renaming
                Music for Cars to A Brief Inquiry Into Online Relationships. It was released on 30 November 2018. The
                band headlined both Radio 1's Big Weekend in Stewart Park, Middlesbrough on 26 May 2019[87] and Reading
                and Leeds Festival in August 2019.[88]
                The album was shortlisted for the 2019 Mercury Music Prize[89] and won the award for British Album of
                the Year at the 2019 Brit Awards.[90]
                On 24 July 2019, the opening song of Notes on a Conditional Form, titled "The 1975", was released,
                featuring climate activist Greta Thunberg, the proceeds of the song going to Extinction Rebellion.[91]
                The lead single, entitled "People" released on 22 August 2019. This was announced by a countdown on the
                band's social media accounts, including small snippets of lyrics from the song that fans could piece
                together. A second single, titled "Frail State of Mind", was released on 24 October. The music video for
                the song was released on 30 November 2019. The next single, "Me & You Together Song", was released on 16
                January 2020.
                On 15 February, the group did their UK tour that lasted until 3 March 2020. The tour began in
                Nottingham's Motor point arena, which holds a capacity of 10,000, and they ended their tour in Dublin
                after performing in Places such as London's O2, Manchester, Glasgow and other hit places in the UK. On
                17 February 2020, the band put up a "digital detox" website called MindShowerAI which contained a
                countdown to their next single as well as several odd messages like “I am doing my mind and my life!”
                and “I feel comfort and respect."[92] A fourth single, ‘The Birthday Party’, was released on 19 February
                2020 at the end of the website's countdown. On 3 April, the band released "Jesus Christ 2005 God Bless
                America", featuring guest vocals from Phoebe Bridgers, which was followed by "If You're Too Shy (Let Me
                Know)", featuring guest vocals by FKA Twigs, on 23 April 2020.[93][94]
                The band's fourth album, Notes on a Conditional Form, was released on 22 May 2020.[95] It became the
                band's fourth consecutive album to reach number one on the UK Albums Chart as well as reaching number
                one in Australia and number four in the United States.[96] On 4 December 2020, the album became
                certified silver in the UK via Brits certified.
                Many of the band's 2020 shows which were postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic were ultimately
                cancelled. During this time, lead singer Matty Healy teased future music under the name "Drive Like I
                Do", and said that the band was working on their fifth studio album, although there was no indication as
                to when writing, recording, mixing, etc. would be complete.[97]
                In February 2021, No Rome, a Dirty Hit labelmate, announced he was working on a track featuring the 1975
                along with Charli XCX, which would make it the second No Rome single to feature the band after 2018's
                "Narcissist".[98][99][100][101][102] The track's title is "Spinning" and was released on 4 March
                2021.[103] An EP that Healy and Daniel produced and co-wrote, Beabadoobee's Our Extended Play, was
                released in March 2021.[104][105] In October 2021, Healy opened for Phoebe Bridgers at the Greek Theatre
                in Los Angeles on her Reunion Tour. He performed two new songs, one called "New York".[106]
                On 14 February 2022, the band deactivated their main social media accounts, hinting at new
                material.[107] On 1 June, the band's social media accounts were re-activated, and the beginning of a new
                era was signalled by a series of posts, and updates to the band's official website.
                In late June 2022, the first single "Part of the Band" from their fifth album Being Funny in a Foreign
                Language was teased. Postcards sent to fans revealed an album track listing, while posters of Healy in
                London promoted the single. The lyrics of "Part of the Band" were posted by Healy on Instagram. The song
                was released on 7 July. On 14 October, the album was released.[108] On 1 October, the band appeared on
                BBC Two's Later... with Jools Holland.[109][110]
                On 7 November 2022, the band performed a sold-out show at Madison Square Garden,[111] which was also
                live-streamed on Twitch.[112] The show—one of the first few in their At Their Very Best tour—was highly
                acclaimed with some critics praising it for its boldness,[113] while others wrote that the band proved
                they really were "at their very best."[114][115][116] It received five star reviews from the Rolling
                Stone,[117] NME,[118] The Observer,[119] The Telegraph,[120] Evening Standard,[121] and Metro.[122]
                A follow-up North American arena tour, with expanded production, is scheduled to commence in 2023 titled
                Still... At Their Very Best.[123] It will be their biggest tour to date in the region.[124][125] In
                August 2023, they are due to headline Reading and Leeds Festivals for the third time with a "10th
                Anniversary Performance" of their self-titled debut album.[126]
                The band was banned from performing in Malaysia due to "controversial conduct and remarks" during their
                performance at the Good Vibes Festival on 21 July 2023. This included a same-sex kiss onstage between
                Healy and MacDonald, and Healy openly criticising the country's strong anti-LGBT laws.[127][128] The
                remainder of the festival was then cancelled by local authorities[128] leaving many of the vendors at
                the venue with food left unsold.[129] On 23 July, the band cancelled the rest of their Asia tour,
                including performances in Indonesia and Taiwan; they cited "current circumstances" as the reason.[130] A
                legal letter was delivered to the band from the organiser on 7 August 2023, demanding that the band
                admits to its liabilities and for a £2 million compensation for intentional breach of contract within
                seven days. The organiser stated that the band had given a written assurance that it would follow all
                laws and regulations of Malaysia before they could perform.[131]

            <h3>Musical style and influences</h3>
            <p>NPR noted that Healy "has long treated writing songs for the 1975 as his diary".[132] Per The Guardian, his lyrics distinguish the 1975's music from other artists'.[133] Healy and Daniel are the principal songwriters of the band with Daniel describing himself as the "primary producer" and Healy as the "primary songwriter".[134][135] Healy has described their relationship as "symbiotic": "We've got a shared musical vocabulary. Even if we're both working remotely, we're both working together."[136]
                Healy specifically cites Talking Heads, My Bloody Valentine, Ride, and Michael Jackson as musical influences; he states that his greatest influence is the oeuvre of filmmaker John Hughes.[36] Healy said that their influence is "heavily rooted" in African-American music in many interviews.[137][138][139][140]
                The 1975 is known for their artistic reinventions and musical eclecticism.[141][142][143] Their debut album has been described as electropop,[144][145] funk rock,[144] indie pop,[144] indie rock,[144] pop,[146][147][148] pop rock[149] and rock.[144] Scott Kerr of AllMusic wrote that the band combined "the dark and youthful themes of sex, love, and fear with ethereal alt-rock music."[150]
                For their second album, I Like It When You Sleep, for You Are So Beautiful yet So Unaware of It, Healy cited Christina Aguilera,[151] D'Angelo, Roberta Flack, Boards of Canada, and Sigur Rós as inspirations saying that they're "a post-modern pop band that references a million things. I don't even know what my band is half the time."[152] The band has been described as indie rock,[153] pop[153][154] and has been classified as a pop rock band.[155][156]</p>
            <h4>Impact</h4>
            <p>Healy and the band has been described by several publications as "the voice of a generation".[157][158][159] Rolling Stone stated that the band has been at "the forefront of modern pop rock" since their debut.[8] Pitchfork has described them as a "band of friends" who "ascended from scrappy emo rockers to global superstars".[9] Entertainment Weekly has characterized them as "British Phenoms,"[10] with Billboard declaring them "the most ambitious pop-rock band of their generation".[11] The Guardian has called them "Britain's Biggest Band" in 2020,[160] with The Telegraph calling them "Britain's Hottest Band" in 2023.[161]
                The 1975's influence in the indie pop scene has been termed "Healywave" by NME.[162] Described as "deftly plucked, palm-muted guitar line, hop, skip and jumping its way across shimmering pop synth work and third-wave emo lyricism," The Big Issue added that it's a "dreamified take on Eighties pop-rock".[163] "Healywave" acts named by the NME include Pale Waves, Fickle Friends, and the Aces among others.</p>
